# Netflix-Clone
Netflix Clone using HTMl and CSS

This is a small practice project I created while learning HTML and CSS.
It helped me understand the fundamentals of structuring a webpage and applying basic styling.
The project is simple and was built purely for learning purposes. 
Since no JavaScript is used, the website is not interactive and it's focused entirely on layout and design.
